I have used many TODO and productivity programs. Many of them without
success. I have used in the last 5 years  a range of applications including simple
text files, Chandler, TimeTo and even Emacs' <a href="http://orgmode.org">Org-mode</a> (totally awesome). I really
liked <a href="http://orgmode.org">Org-mode</a>, however, it really got a bit chaotic and the lack of
structure kind of bothered me. Also, the fact that it integrated bad (or not
at all) with things like my Google calendar other related services made me
look for an alternative.
</p>



<p>
Around 1.5 years ago I got a Macbook Pro, so I decided to try a Mac based TODO
list application called <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>. It was not as completed as Org but it was
simple and beautiful. Initially it kind of worked OK, but after some months I
started to notice some limitations regarding of how to handle projects and
the integration with the calendar. Then, after an update, they changed some
important features, breaking my "<a href="http://xkcd.com/1173/">workflow</a>".
</p>




<p>
I almost decided to go back to Org but I continued looking for alternatives,
and I finally found a little jewel called <a href="http://www.2doapp.com/">2Do</a>. It is really similar to Things, but
brings more structure and semantics for managing ToDos (same structures I
used in Org-Mode) plus other features that I find interesting, like linking a
TODO to a particular location and a really good integration with iCloud /
Calendar.

<p>
Now, I have a lot of stuff in Things and I really did not want to copy and
paste everything.  Also in Thing you can't just copy several TODOs at
one. So what TODO? (get the pun? :-P).

Well I discovered that Things offered and scripting interface using
AppleScript. I don't really know a lot of Mac OSX and all these things, I come
from Linux world and anything else but Perl and Bash doesn't sound to me
really to "script". Anyway it looks like that the Apple guys have a nice
environment for scripting using this "<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptX/Concepts/osa.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001571-BABEBGCF">AppleScript</a>" language (kind of weird, looks
like Lisp at times). Things offered an  scripting interface and you can
access this programmatically do pretty much all you want with it You can see
the capabilities of Things (and other scriptable applications like Finder
and Evernote) using the AppleScript editor and the dictionary explorer (see
screen-shot).
</p>





<p>
Cool. The problem is now that  2Do
still doesn't not provide such an interface, but at least if you copy and
paste several lines from at text file,  it will create a TODO item for each line
copied. Good enough.

</div>


<p>
So, I just have to quickly learn this new Scripting language?. Well, not, I
am to lazy for that (although Things offered <a href="http://downloads.culturedcode.com/things/download/ThingsAppleScriptGuide.pdf">a nice AppleScript guide</a> with a
nice set of snippet to work with the Things objects). I discovered that Apple
offered a <i>Scripting Bridge</i> so you can access this scriptable application
from other languages. So why not use my favorite Language (Ruby) and quickly
throw some lines and get all my todos into text files so I can easily import
them into 2Do? Piece of cake, I just need to install <a href="http://www.macruby.org">MacRuby</a> in order to
access this cool feature. 
</p>





<p>
Well, Not so fast cowboy, I can easily access all the objects but there was
some problems with this. For example AppleScript sometimes properties have spaces and this is not as nicely
mapped to Ruby as you would expect. After wasting time using irb I found
this <a href="http://www.silicontrip.net/~mark/view.php/blog/20111214">cool post</a> from a guy who suffered something similar (thanks mate) and I
found out  how to access the important properties. 
</p>

<p>
So finally this LONG script, run it with MacRuby and check out the code comments
for extra quirks I found while finding out how to it:
</p>

<p>
If I have time and desire  I might make a AppleScript version of this so
more people can use it.
