I have done a little bit of Machine Learning back in college, I paralellized
a transductive SVM to get improvement over the a really slow algorithm so the topic still interest me. I just discovered a cool article by Google Research  about empiric lesson learned while developing a real world machine learning algorithms.

* "Lessons learned developing a practical large scale machine learning system":http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2010/04/lessons-learned-developing-practical.html

Now while reading my feed I discovered this article that introduces a cool machine learning algorith for ranking and matching players for the Xbox live. It also have a good introduction to statistical machine learning. Totally recommended.


* "Computing Your Skill":http://www.moserware.com/2010/03/computing-your-skill.html


Happy reading :-) .
