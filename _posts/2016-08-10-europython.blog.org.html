I attended this year once again and it was pretty amazing. The weather did not help a lot but both the content and
the people were really good.
This time I gave a short talk about some of the things I leared in these couple of years using Python for
data processing. The idea was to show a wide range of topics so the talk was not a hardcore technical talk but
quite basic.

There is also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBcfWqNCvmA">video</a> available for the curious.

Overall a good experience, some really good talks, in particular the lighting talk show was really entertaining. KeyNotes
were really well selected and the food was ok. I missed some of the nice sponsor from last year and Microsoft did not even show up.

Next year is going to be in Milan, so I am really looking forward to the next year's Europython.
