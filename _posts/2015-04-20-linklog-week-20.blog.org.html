This blog post was in the making for a while. I think I got distracted with many things (including a move to Berlin, more on that later). I am also started writing
some posts on <a href="https://medium.com/@mfcabrera">Medium</a>, I will continue using it mostly for non-technical stuff.
</p>

<p>
For now let just  publish this:

<h2 id="orgheadline1">Burda Hackday - The Futute of Finance</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline1">
<p>
I participated in the Burda Hackathon about the future of finance. Here's my <a href="https://medium.com/@mfcabrera/about-hacks-and-finance-d16daeb9a8b3">report</a>
on the experience.

<h2 id="orgheadline2">Colombian Salaries Survey.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
A bit of self-promotion here. Famous Colombian entrepreneur <a href="https://twitter.com/torrenegra">Alexander Torrenegra</a> recently released the results from a Survey about the salaries of  <a href="http://bunnyinc.com/blog/survey-results-much-colombian-software-developers-really-make">Colombian Software Developers</a>.
I wrote an aticle <a href="https://medium.com/colombia-dev/yet-another-post-about-how-much-colombian-software-developers-really-make-3c1bcda8b11a">Medium</a>  Medium that uses the data in a slightly different way.

<h2 id="orgheadline3">Mining Massive Data Sets</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
This year I started some very interesting MOOCs, I couldn't complete all of them. However, I did finish <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/mmds">Mining Massive Data Sets</a> from Coursera and got the Certificate. I have to say
that this is one of the best online course I have taken so far. I think the diversity and usefulness of the topics are high and made me look at topic I previously have seen
in a different way. I can say the only thing I did not like from the course is Prof. Ullman. I mean he is great, but his videos in the course were the most "heavy" way less
entertaining. However the overall course structure and videos are great. I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to deep dive into massive data processing. A background
in machine

<h2 id="orgheadline4">What the F**K</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline4">
<p>
I found this nice tool called <i><a href="https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck">thefuck</a></i>  that tries to match a wrong command to a correct one using your command history. Basically if after writing a wrong command line you
write fuck it will try to automatically fix it.

<h2 id="orgheadline5">Pig DataFu</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline5">
<p>
Lately I have been working with Pig. A Dataflow programming languages. Really
useful for juggling with data.  I have been writing UDFs and playing with
some advanced functionality of it. At TrustYouwe use a library that I did not know before. It is called <a href="http://datafu.incubator.apache.org/">DataFu</a> and it contains a lot of useful techniques.
