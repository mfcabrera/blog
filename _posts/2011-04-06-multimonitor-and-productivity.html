I have always loved multi-monitor set-up. There has been evidence that having
multiple monitors with the appropiate screen size can make people more
productivem, specially programmers. A <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/03/does-more-than-one-monitor-improve-productivity.html">lot</a> of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">people</a> (including  <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/2172392/Randy-Pausch-Time-Management-Lecture-Transcript">Randy Pausch</a>, R.I.P) supports
this idea. 
</p>
<p>
I personally I believed in the same and since 2006 I use  multimonitor setup
in my home. I haven't measured how more "productive" I am (at home I
don't do a lot of programming) However, I can say it is definetly a pleasure to
work this way. 
</p>
<p>
I always wondered if there was some scientfically based evience of
this, However I did not bother to search for them.  Today I found a <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1700/does-more-monitor-real-estate-increase-productivity">question</a>
on <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/">Skeptics</a> (a StackOverflow backed site) about the same topic. And a lot of
scientific literature is referenced. You can see them on the top answers to
this topics. 
</p>
<p>
So, it looks like may help having multiple monitors, at least it will save a
little bit of time. From my experience, and when programming, generally I
like to have the reference manual or examples of what I am particulary doing.
When using  one monitor I have to switch between windows in order to get the
info I need. If I have two or more displays I am able to put the info side to
side without wasting my time in window management.

<p>
Sadly, in my current job I don't have access to a second display, the main
reason is that I only posses a single video card with a single output
(VGA). So, it is imposible to have a second independent display. However,
there are some alternatives. One  many usb-based video card (pretty much of
all them based in DisplayLink technology) that cost arround 40-80 USD. They
are sometimes laggy and does not wokr for video. But, for a programmers life
which is pretty much text based or web surfing  I think it will be enoguh.
