I have always loved multi-monitor set-up. There has been evidence that having
multiple monitors with the appropiate screen size can make people more
productivem, specially programmers. A <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/03/does-more-than-one-monitor-improve-productivity.html">lot</a> of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">people</a> (including  <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/2172392/Randy-Pausch-Time-Management-Lecture-Transcript">Randy Pausch</a>, R.I.P) supports
this idea. 
</p>
<p>
I personally I believed in the same and since 2006 I use  multimonitor setup
in my home. I haven't measured how more "productive" I am (at home I
don't do a lot of programming) However, I can say it is definetly a pleasure to
work this way. 
</p>

I always wondered if there was some scientfically based evience of
this, However I did not bother to search for them.  Today I found a <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1700/does-more-monitor-real-estate-increase-productivity">question</a>
on <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/">Skeptics</a> (a StackOverflow backed site) about the same topic. And a lot of
scientific literature is referenced. You can see them on the top answers to
this topics.

So, it looks like may help having multiple monitors, at least it will save a
little bit of time. From my experience, and when programming, generally I
like to have the reference manual or examples of what I am particulary doing.
When using  one monitor I have to switch between windows in order to get the
info I need. If I have two or more displays I am able to put the info side to
side without wasting my time in window management.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, in my current job I don't have access to a second display, the main
reason is that I only posses a single video card with a single output
(VGA). So, it is imposible to have a second independent display. However,
there are some alternatives. One  many usb-based video card (pretty much of
all them based in DisplayLink technology) that cost arround 40-80 USD. They
are sometimes laggy and does not wokr for video. But, for a programmers life
which is pretty much text based or web surfing  I think it will be enough.
</p>

<p> In my case I've got
  the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IE49T8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=displ0a-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B003IE49T8">lugable
  UGA-125 USB 2.0 to VGA/DVI/HDMI </a>. I found an a spare monitor that no
  one was using and moved it to my place. The installation was easy  under
  windows (my job official OS). 
</p>
<p>After some time using two monitors I feel totally happy and although I
  don't have the data, I that feel I waste less time while writing code, and
  well, doing other not so enjoyable tasks :-).</p>
