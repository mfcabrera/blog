<h2 id="sec-1">TL;DR</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I explore a set-up to share notes among all my devices (namely my Laptop,
tablet and smart-phone) and make them
available on the cloud, plus how to even work with them from Emacs. I even
show how I use the same system for blogging. If you
are a OSX and Emacs use and also happen to have a device from Apple (e.g.
Macbook Pro or iPhone) read below. 
</p>


<p>
I have always been obsessed with personal productivity, and even though I
sometimes thing that the whole thing is pointless, I keep trying to improve my
"workflow" to make me  more productive. Around 6 months ago I found a way to
combine some applications together to take notes everywhere. Thus, I would
like to share with the world.
</p>

<p>
I have separated the configuration by levels of "geekness". Level 1 is for more normal
people while upper levels are more for Ã¼ber geeks (those which use  Emacs / Org
Mode). I will also show how I how use the same note taking system to even
write the blog you are reading right now.
</p>

<p>
I know many of the current Org-users that read this might think I am not
using the complete power of org-mode, and that org-mode offer other
alternatives, but this way it is simple enough for me and everyone is free
to adapt it as they want (isn't org-mode flexibility all about?).

<p>
You can safely skip this part if you want to get the set-up running. Here I
just want or rant a little bit about my experience in the note taking field.
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned before, I have always been obsessed with personal productivity. In particular to-do
list and note taking. Back in the days, I used simple text files for storing
my notes, then I switched to personal wiki solutions like the once popular
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Tomboy">Tomboy</a> . Then I switched to integrated solutions like <i><a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a></i> 
. I think org-mode is pure  awesomeness  but I just do not like
as the notes are stored and accessed. The main issues I have found when using
org-mode are the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In org-mode the usual set-up implies  all the notes are stored in one or
some files in a tree fashion.
</li>
<li>Search in Org-Mode is not as flexible and quick as I would like it to be. 
</li>
<li>Accessing my org files from other devices different of my computer was a
PITA. and <a href="http://mobileorg.ncogni.to/">MobileOrg</a> did not cover my needs (and was also difficult to Set-up).
</li>
<li>Furthermore, Integrating org-mode although possible is sometimes too
difficult or cumbersome.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>  has a lot of things that make it rock:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can use the awesome Emacs to take notes.
</li>
<li><a href="http://orgmode.org/org.html#Markup">Simple format</a>  for storing information that can be used with or
without syntax highlight.
</li>
<li>The ability to export to many formats including Latex, PDF and HTML.
</li>
<li>Syntax for  highlighting when exporting.
</li>
<li>Executing of source code via <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/">Org Babel</a>
</li>
<li>And more, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/org-mode#Functionality">much more</a>.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
So I stared looking initially for ways  to be able to access my notes from
everywhere. Once I got that figured out I started looking for ways to use org-mode to takes notes while at the
same time being able to have read write access from wherever I wanted.  And
below you will find my solution.

<h2 id="sec-3">Set-Up</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Before starting to describe I want to clarify what hardware I possess. The
setup might be replicated with a different set of devices  or operating
system combination. I will try to add the alternatives.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Laptop with Mac OSX: Macbook Pro
</li>
<li>Cellphone: iPhone (&gt;=4)
</li>
<li>Tablet: iPad (&gt;=3)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
(Yeah, yeah&#x2026; you can call me Apple fan boy but I'm not!)

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">LvL 1: Notes in all devices</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
In order to achieve this we only need a couple of applications. Notational
Velocity and SimpleNote.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">Notational Velocity &amp; SimpleNote</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
<a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a> is an  open source light weight text editor with really
nice functionalities. It features a simple interface with a search bar and a list of notes.
</p>

<div class="img-center">
<a href="/files/images/nv-screenshot.png" target='_blank'>
<img style="width:70%" alt="Notational Velocity" src="/files/images/nv-screenshot.png"
class="img-polaroid"  /> 
</a>
<p> Notational Velocity </p>
</div>


<p>
Notational Velocity allows the user to select in which directory to store
the notes. So if we select a Dropbox folder  we can browse it basically from everywhere.
</p>

<p>
To access the notes in other devices, I use  <a href="http://simplenote.com/">SimpleNote</a> (if you don't know
this application you should totally check it out).  
Notational Velocity can sync your notes with SimpleNote. The Web version of
SimpleNote is free but you have to  pay for this app in order to use it in
iOS device. It is cheap and totally make easier to share your computer
notes with you iOS device(s). 
</p>

<p>
Here is actually how SimpleNote looks on the iPad:
</p>

<div class="img-center">
<a href="/files/images/simplenoteipad.jpg" target="_blank">
<img  style="width:70%;"  src="/files/images/simplenoteipad.jpg"  class="img-polaroid"  /> 
</a>
<p> SimpleNote on iPad </p>
</div>

<p>
So by using Dropbox, Notational Velocity and SimpleNote you can:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Take plain text notes using a free cool app.
</li>
<li>Access it everywhere using Dropbox (if you need to, but this is more of a
emergency).
</li>
<li>Take notes online using the Simple note <a href="https://simple-note.appspot.com/">Web interface</a>  or any of
the clients it has. Notational velocity will sync back to your hard drive
and Dropbox folder.
</li>
<li>Sync and take notes using any or your devices iPhone  or Emacs. I guess
this configuration will also work or Android based devices,  but I have no
experience with Android based devices. However by this point, the main
idea should be clear and should not be hard to replicate.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So you can stop reading here if you are not a user of Emacs (or if this
level of Geeknes is enough for you).
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">LvL 2: Using Emacs to take notes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
OK if you are reading this that means that you are an active user of Emacs
and that you want to see how you can integrate the previous Workflow with
it. Well it  is actually quite easy.  
</p>

<p>
There is a special mode in Emacs called <a href="http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/">Deft</a> with basically provides Emacs a
similar interface for note taking as Notational Velocity does.
</p>


<div class="img-center">
<a href="http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/browser.png" target="_blank">
<img   src="http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/browser.png"  class="img-polaroid"  /> 
</a>
<p> Deft Mode </p>
</div>

<p>
Deft configuration is simple (add this to <code>.emacs</code> ):
</p>


<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elisp">(when (require 'deft nil 'noerror) 
  (setq
   deft-extension "txt"
   deft-directory "~/Dropbox/Notational Data/"
   deft-text-mode 'org-mode
   deft-use-filename-as-title t
   )
  (global-set-key (kbd "&lt;C-f9&gt;") 'deft))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This should be self-explanatory, but the important things are the
<code>:deft-directory</code> option, which I select the same directory on my Dropbox
folde. The <code>:deft-text-mode</code> option allows me to chose a default mode for my
note files. 
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">LvL 3: Writing a blog from everywhere</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
So far we have the ability of writing and reading or text or org based mode
from everywhere. This can be used to write draft of posts for your blog  from basically everywhere.
In my personal case I use <a href="http:https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a> to generate this blog. Jekyll natively
support markup formats like Markdown or Textile, but you can use raw HTML as
well. This last feature allows me  to write  my posts using org-mode format
and export them to HTML. This can be easily automated by defining a
project. 
</p>


<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elisp">(setq org-publish-project-alist
   '(

     ("mf" :components ("mf-org"
                         "mf-img"))

      ("mf-org"
               :base-directory "/Users/miguel/Dropbox/Notational Data"
               :recursive t 
               :base-extension "blog.org.txt"
               :publishing-directory "/Users/miguel/Dropbox/blog-stuff/mfcabrera.com/_posts"
               :site-root "http://mfcabrera.com"
               :jekyll-sanitize-permalinks t
               :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
               :section-numbers nil
               :headline-levels 4
               :table-of-contents nil
               :auto-index nil
               :auto-preamble nil
               :body-only t
               :auto-postamble nil)

      ("mf-img"
               :base-directory "/Users/miguel/Dropbox/blog-stuff/source/"
               :recursive t
               :exclude "^publish"
               :base-extension "jpg\\|gif\\|png|jpeg"
               :publishing-directory "/Users/miguel/Dropbox/blog-stuff/mfcabrera.com/files/images"

               :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)



))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There are three project <code>mf-org</code> and <code>mf-img</code> and <code>mf</code>. With <code>mf-org</code> I
define  base directory (where I have all my notes). <code>:base-extension</code> tells org-mode to
only take into account files ending in <code>.blog.org.txt</code> (So I don't publish
all my notes).  With <code>:body-only</code> I
tell org to export only the body of the HTML.  <code>mf-img</code> takes images from
a directory and copies to <code>/files/images/ directory</code> using the function
<code>:org-publish-attachment</code>. 
</p>

<p>
This allow me for example to start writing a blog-post using my iPad (or even
my cellphone) and then when I get access to a computer just format it a bit
and generate it. However, this apparently has not made my blog more
active. However, I will try to actually do it more often now that I finally
finished my M.Sc. degrees :).
