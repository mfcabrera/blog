I am in love. Yes, I am really and deeply in love. I am in love with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOOCs">MOOCs</a> :). But what are MOOCs?
The term MOOC stand for massive open online course. According to the <a href="http://moocguide.wikispaces.com/">MOOC
guide</a> a MOOC is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[&#x2026;] a Massive Open Online Course. It is a gathering of participants, of
people willing to jointly exchange knowledge and experiences for each of them to build upon.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOOC">Wikipedia</a> defines it as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
an online course aiming at large-scale participation and open access via the web.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, a MOOC is an online course aimed to a large audience, audience which
interact not only with the tutors of a particular course, but also among
themselves. I find that not only really cool but also amazing. Taking the
same lecture with thousands of students from all over the world that most of
the time are supportive and help you wherever you have a question.
</p>

<p>
I guess that although most of the readers  of this blog  are familiar with the term,
I am sure that many have not taken one of these courses offered  any
of the MOOC websites. Therefore, I want to share my experiences and views as
a user of these platforms.
</p>

<p>
So, what makes them different from  watching some videos on YouTube or just
reading the slides online? ( Or for that matter paying for some online tutorial/screencast).
Here is what I found different and noteworthy:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Interactive</b>:  many of the pre-existing online education sites offered
recording of the lectures. Although of good quality, they cannot replace
the one to one relationship that can be established when a single
person is attending a lecture.  Current MOOC use questions inside the videos
(I would not dare to call this a 'interactive video'),
allowing the user to  double check if they are actually understanding the
content the instructor is  trying to explain. That somehow  replaces the
"in-class interaction" that  one have when attending a real-world class room.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Timed</b>: these courses run during some fixed time. With this one I have
love-hate relationship. I do like that these courses are timed, because it
allows the university and instructor to commit to the teaching and also
helps for them to know when a critical mass of student will be taking the
class. For students, it is also helpful to know that they will be able to find
people ready to answer their questions.  The bad thing is that the homeworkers
/ exams are also held during this time span. Late submission generally decreases a lot the grade. So for a late starter it will be really hard to score a good grade
or even get a certificate of accomplishment.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>this takes me to my next point: <b>The courses are scored</b> and sometimes you
can get a certificate of completion. And sometimes even <a href="http://help.coursera.org/customer/portal/articles/502510-will-i-get-university-credit-for-taking-this-course-">credits</a>! For me the
fact that you get grade / recognized for your work is
one of the most important. Before that, I started courses of watched some
videos on <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">MIT OCW</a> / YouTube, but as the time passed I eventually forgot
that I was actually taking the class. Having some sort of recognition helps
(at least me) to keep on track.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Interactive</b> (again): but I am not talking about the  "video" this time
but more about the fact they are forums where you can ask questions if some
topic is clear enough or just give feedback. On this forums, no only other
members of the "class" can answer but there also the equivalent of teaching
assistants that generally answer quite fast to the students questions.  In
other opportunities when I watched some videos, e.g. In YouTube, I just
have the comments. I once even dared to send an e-mail to a professor but
of course, I received no answer :).</li>
</ul>


<p>
Currently there are many sites
that offer MOOCs, being <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>  and <a href="https://www.edx.org/">Edx</a> the
most popular (also free). There are also other courses that not necessarily
use any of these sites, like the large scale <a href="http://cilvr.cs.nyu.edu/doku.php?id=courses:bigdata:start">machine learning course</a>
taught by Prof.  <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/">Yann LeCunn</a> and <a href="http://hunch.net/">John Langford</a> at NYU.
</p>

<p>
One characteristic that these platforms had was that most of the courses were
in English and about most of them were about technical subjects, mostly related to computer science. Nowadays   this is mo longer true. Today
there are many non technical courses available, like music and history  and
courses  in Spanish and French can also be found. Related to
this, Coursera recently announced courses from more university worldwide
adding more languages and topics to the offer, including my <a href="https://www.coursera.org/tum">University</a> and
coincidentally my IDP evaluator <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compvision">Prof. Kleinsteuber</a>.

<p>
I personally feel that I have not taken advantage of the existing course offering, most
of the time  this is due  to timing issues. I have taken Introduction to
Artificial Intelligence parts of<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml"> Machine
Learning</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/nlp">NLP</a> and I have just finished completely the course
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/digitalsounddesign">Introduction to Sound Design</a>. I am currently trying to follow course
"Algorithm Design" but I started late due to my semester final exams and a 3
weeks trip through my country I had planned way in advance. I will try to
finish it (although I will not receive any certificate) and try to attend the ones
available in the future. There are many interesting upcoming course, I just
hope I will have time and determination to finish it.
</p>

<p>
To conclude, I think there was no time before where the access to
quality education material was as easy and free as today. I think that this
is just the start, and step by step the classical classroom approach will be
outdated, and it will start to shift into a more massive and collaborative
approach to learning. I am not claiming now that MOOCs are going to replace
the university experience completely, but this wills definitely affect it. To
what extend it is yet to be seen.

As a bonus, a nice graph showing interesting numbers. This graph comes from an  <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/online-learning-campus-2-0-1.12590">article</a> on the last issue of Nature on the impact of
online learning / MOOCs on higher education:
