This year I had the chance to attend the Lisbon Machine Learning (Summer)
School LxMLS.  In this post  I want share my experiences as well as of give
my opinion on how some things could be improved.

<h2 id="sec-2">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
<a href="http://lxmls.it.pt/2014/">Lisbon Machine Learning Summer School</a> (LxMLS)  is an intensive school on Machine Learning held in the
beautiful city of Lisbon in Portugal. What is  special about this 
school,  is that it has an specific emphasis on  applications of  Machine
Learning in the field of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language Processing</a> (NLP). 
I believe this is because most of the organizers
are somehow connected to  NLP research groups and companies in Lisbon as well to
the <a href="http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/">CMU Language Technology Institute</a> and the <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/">IST</a>. This was appealing to me as I
wrote  my M.Sc.  thesis on the topic of applications of  word vector representations.  However,
I only used them for document  classification when they their  more interesting
applications are in the field of NLP. 
</p>

<p>
The summer school was designed in such way that  in the morning we received a tutorial /
lecture  on a specific topic of  ML &amp; NLP;  and in the afternoon,  a
practical session was held   directly related to the lecture received in the morning. After the labs,  a short
presentation featuring more research results was scheduled.
</p>

<p>
In this post I describe briefly the summer school 
school and I give an account of my experience.
This is my personal opinion  and thus,  it might not be shared by many of the attendees as the
school experience will vary based on their backgrounds and expectations.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Day 0 - Tuesday</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The first day started with a quick introduction and presentation of the
summer school. Shortly afterwards <a href="http://www.lx.it.pt/~mtf/">Prof. Mario Figuerido</a> kicked off the
school with a  review of basic probability concepts. 
I have to admit that it was helpful to refresh  some things.  The morning talk  was an introduction to
Python by <a href="http://luispedro.org/">Luis Pedro Coelho</a> from the <a href="http://www.embl.de">EMBL</a>, which was  necessary for  those with no previous knowledge
of the programming language, as the programming exercises of the lab
sessions required  basic Python knowledge. The Lab session of the afternoon was
focused  on getting Python
installed.  There were a couple of exercises about gradient descent.   The fist day we did not have an evening short talk but instead a
welcome reception where we could do some networking while eating snacks and
drinking wine. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Day 1 - Wednesday</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The second day we had an introduction to machine learning and linear
classifiers by <a href="http://www.ryanmcd.com/">Ryan McDonald</a> from Google. I liked this presentation, however
at the beginning I had issues understanding the part on how the feature
extraction worked (as it was a bit NLP-focused). At times the slides got filled
with mathematical derivation that in my opinion did not help to make the
concepts clearer.
</p>

<p>
In the evening we had  to implement the Multinomial Naïve Bayes for
document classification. We basically had to fill the <code>train</code> method from a
existing class (it reminded me of the<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml"> ML-class</a> from Coursera). As it happens, I have never
implemented this (it is  -/a well motivated- counting/-
basically), so it was nice to finally do it.
</p>

<p>
The evening talk was a tutorial on <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html%20">Scikit-Learn</a> by <a href="http://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/~amueller/">Andreas Müller</a>, one of the main
contributors to the project.  The funny thing is that I had used parts of
his  tutorial for <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mfcabrera/munich-datageeks-introduction-to-svm-using-python">my talk on SVMs</a> at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Munich-Datageeks/">Datageeks Meetup</a>. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Day 2 - Thursday</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
On day three we had a talk on sequence models by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nasmith/">Noah Smith</a>, leader of the
CMU's group <i><a href="http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/">Noah's Ark</a></i>. I was particularly interested in this talk  because
I have no experience with sequence models or with their  application to NLP
tasks. I really liked the presentation style and the slides, however by the
end of the talk the it became a bit esoteric for me and it was hard to
follow.
</p>

<p>
In the practical session we were required to implement the Viterbi
algorithm. I was at the beginning pretty lost but with the help of some of
the instructors I was able to complete the task.
</p>

<p>
After the lab we went to the LxMLS Demo Day where local companies and
research groups showed their products and research. From all the boots I liked two local
companies: <a href="https://www.unbabel.com/">Unbabel</a> and <a href="http://labs.priberam.com/">Priberam</a>. Unbabel is a Y-Combinator backed
that offer crowdsourced human corrected machine translation. I found the
service pretty cool. Priberam is a company offering a NLP related
services. They have a strong research group connected to the <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/"><i>Instituto
Superior Técnico</i></a>.

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Day 3 - Friday</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Friday morning we had a talk on learning structured predictors from <a href="http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~carreras/">Xavier
Carreras</a> of Xerox Research. This was another one I liked and I was looking
forward  to it. For most of the talk I could somehow follow, but once again
by the end it was a little hard to get everything.  The afternoon lab was
about implementing the structured perceptron algorithm. 
</p>

<p>
I have to say I could not follow the evening talk at all. It was something
related to Spectral Learning by <a href="http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~aquattoni/">Ariadna Quanttoni</a>. I think it was too
specialized and the scope was not appropriate for the  summer school.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">Day 4 - Saturday</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
For Saturday we had a talk on Syntax and Parsing form <a href="http://www.petrovi.de/">Slav Petrov</a>. This was
really hard to follow. I guess if you don't have a good background in NLP that
would be the case. However, the main concepts were understandable. In the
lab session we were required to play with  existent code related to
parsing. 
</p>

<p>
The evening talk was given by <a href="http://www.dipanjandas.com/">Dipanjas Das</a> from Google on <a href="http://lxmls.it.pt/2014/dipanjandas-lxmls.pdf">Cross-Lingual
Learning in Natural Language Syntax</a>. Pretty advance topic, but I really liked
how the presenter moved from basic concepts to more complex techniques. This
was one of my favorites presentation.

<div id="outline-container-sec-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-8">Day 5 - Monday</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
After the free day (which I used to visit Sintra along with some cool people
I met in the school - High guys :D!) We returned to the school for the last two days.
Monday was the day for the Big Data  topics with CMU Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdyer/">Chris Dyer</a>. I
also liked this one. It does not only showed the basic of Map Reduce but also
strategies on how to implement the ML and NLP algorithm using this
paradigm. The Afternoon labs were introduced the basic concepts of MR with the
almost pathological word counting problem.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon lecture was about Cross-Lingual Semantics by <a href="http://ivan-titov.org/">Prof. Ivan Titov</a>
of University of Amsterdam. I couldn't follow this talk a lot either. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-9">Day 6 - Tuesday (Final Day)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
I was really looking forward to the talk on Deep Learning by <a href="http://www.socher.org">Richard
Socher</a>. I had already watched his <a href="http://www.socher.org/index.php/DeepLearningTutorial/DeepLearningTutorial">Tutorial on Deep Learning</a> so I was familiar 
with many of the topics. His tutorial was really helpful to understand basic
concepts of Deep Learning. For the afternoon labs we were required to
write/execute a Map Reduce  version of the expectation maximization
algorithm. I did not do much here because I was writing this post :D
</p>

<p>
I could not attend the afternoon talk because there were some problems in the
red line of the metro, which communicates the city with the airport. Thus I
preferred to go to the airport a bit early and I only could catch the first 15
minutes of the lecture.

<div id="outline-container-sec-10" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-10">The Good</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
There were many things that I like about the summer school, I will list here
the ones I believe are the most important:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The people: From the organizers to the attendees. All the people I had the
chance to interact with were really nice. I had interesting conversation
with all of them.
</li>

<li>The Location: Lisbon. What a beautiful city. It is the perfect location for
such event. The IST campus is quite central and easy to reach. 
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The talk ordering was well planned. Every lecturer built on the knowledge
acquired in the previous session.
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Topics: The school covered from the very basics to current topics such
as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Learning">deep learning.</a>
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Speakers: All of the speakers are renown researchers and academics
coming from prestigious institution and companies. We had speakers from
Amazon and Google, as well from universities such as CMU and Stanford.
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Organization Team: The organizers / tutors were always ready to help. 
Every time I had a question or doubt they tried their best to explain. 
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using Python for the Labs. I think that Python is becoming the standard for
NLP / ML / Data Science. It  is also a easy programming language to learn. 
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>




<div id="outline-container-sec-11" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-11">Things to improve</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-11">
<p>
Not everything can be perfect right? There are quite a few things that in my
opinion can be improved for future schools:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use IPython notebooks for the Labs. I think the  toolkit provided
by the school is pretty nice, but the fact that people have to install
Python makes the first day not really smooth. IPython can be served
remotely very easy   so people can access it through the web interface.
Also, a virtual machine could be prepared so the persons do not need to
tinker around installing Python and the required packages.
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I did not like a lot the way the labs were executed. I liked the chosen
topics and the instructors/tutors were really helpful. However, I believe
they should be made more interactive. Also, an explanation of the basics of
each exercise as well how each part of the algorithm relates to the code
was missing. I had a lot trouble understanding a simple part that could
have been easily explained (but it was not clear in the guide).
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>More social events / group activities. I would have loved to have more
group activities. We had dinner in a fancy restaurant but doing other stuff
together would have been nice. A group visit to the castle would have been
a nice idea. 
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Auditorium. The Auditorium were the main lectures were held was OK but
for one thing. The space between the chairs was minimal. I am not <b>that</b>
tall and when I couldn't get a place in the last row or the middle one
(both with extra space) I was all the time uncomfortable. 
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Add a (optional) poster session along with the demo day. I think that might
be helpful for early researchers to discuss the approaches with the
speakers (that are generally experts on the field).  
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Canteen. The Canteen was relatively small and it was shared with
students. So, people had to run to be able to eat 1 hour time-slot. Either
giving more time to have lunch or looking for alternatives is necessary for
next events. 
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-12" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-12">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-12">
<p>
I had a great experience coming here. I had the chance to meet interesting
people as well to learn (or at least get informed) about ML and its
applications to NLP. The talks were relevant and the topics well chosen. I
really enjoyed most of the lectures. 
</p>

<p>
I don't think people come  to the summer school to actually <i>learn</i> something. It
is really hard to fully understand advanced topics in
machine learning and NLP in just one day.  One can however,  <i>get informed</i> about the
subjects and <i>learn what needs to be learned</i>. Also, the networking part is
really important, even more for those early Ph.d. students as they have the
chance to validate approaches with other researchers and experts in the field. 
</p>

<p>
Lisbon is a magical.   I really loved it. It is a  beautiful and organized
city. The public transportation works pretty well and there are
many interesting places to visit both in the city and in the surrounding area.
</p>

<p>
I would recommend this summer school to anyone interested in NLP and in ML in
general. You will not only have the chance to learn but you will also enjoy
what the  beautiful Lisbon and Portugal have to offer.
