<p>
Here a list of interesting events in Europe that  I find interesting and I
would like / will attend in 2013. If you have any suggestions for events 
please comment :-).
</p>

<h3 id="sec-0-1">Make Munich 2013:</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-1">
<p>
Make Munich is a Do-it-yourself/ Hacker / 3d printing exhibition fair in
Munich. I am not really into these topics, but a friend of mine insisted on attending and given that is
relatively inexpensive (if the ticket are bought early enough), I think 
is  a good opportunity to see and learn, and maybe trying get into this topic.

<h3 id="sec-0-2">Eurocamp 2013:</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-2">
<p>
The European Ruby Camp. Although I am not an active Ruby developer (lately mostly
Matlab and soon Python). I love Ruby and when I do small stuff and script I
write them in this language. Also, Ruby meetings are fun. Last year I attended
<a href="http://12.rupy.eu/">RuPy</a>, and although not Ruby exclusive,  a lot of the community members were  present.

<h3 id="sec-0-3">Machine Learning Summer School 2013:</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-3">
<p>
Since I was in Colombia  I wanted to attend a
Machine Learning school. Last year, when I arrived, it  was in the Canaries. It
was also  bit expensive (due to the ticket to the canaries) and I did not have time to properly apply (I just had
arrived some months ago). This year is going to be held in Germany, so it is
quite convinient for me. 
</p>

<p>
One of the requirements for the application is to
send the abstract of a poster that is would be presented by the application
if it get accepted into the summer school. I will send an abstract about the
work I am doing in my interdisciplinary guided research that is related to
Music Information Retrieval.

The problem with this one is that it collides with MLSS :(. But I would
totally love to attend this summer school.
