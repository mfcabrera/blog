This year I wanted to blog more, but it is really hard to focus on writing
while working, studying, learning German and taking <a href="http://coursera.org/">Coursera</a> courses (more on
that hopefully shortly in a another post).
</p>

<p>
For now I just wanted to share that after years of having the same
configuration of <a href="http://gnu.org/s/emacs">Emacs</a>, I changed my configuration. I had been using the same
configuration for some years adding stuff on top of it. It was slow and full
of bugs. Today I discovered that my Python+Yasnippet+AC stopped working for
unknown reasons and that made me realize it was time to create a new
configuration.
</p>

<p>
I also changed the Color theme to "Misterioso"  and I am linking it a lot. I
am not using all the packages I was using before. In particular, for now I
have stopped using <a href="http://ecb.sourceforge.net/">Emacs Code Browser</a> but probably I will install it soon.
</p>


<p>
You can find more details and all the configuration files on the new repo I
have created to track the changes to I will continue making to it:
