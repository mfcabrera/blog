Some weeks ago the second meeting of  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Munich-Datageeks/">Munich DataGeeks</a> took place. Munich DataGeeks is a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">meetup</a>
group I am organizing with <a href="http://florianhartl.com/">Florian Hartl</a> about  what we
like to call <b>intelligent data processing</b>.  After two meet-ups,
with around 45+ attendants each, I feel comfortable saying that  it has been
a success.
In this post I am going to describe the idea
behind the meetup, the structure of it  and some plans for the future.
</p>

<p>
You might be wondering what are we referring to when we say  <b>intelligent
data processing</b>? By that we refer to all those technologies and
techniques used to extract,  process and get insight from data. We don't
limit ourselves  to  a particular technology/buzzword or a programming
language. Therefore, the topics discussed will be really diverse. A
presentation in our group will
probably include things like  NLP, Machine Learning,  Information Retrieval, event processing, Data
Science and related; and technologies such as Hadoop, NoSQL, Python, R, etc.
</p>

<p>
The idea of creating this group came one day after Florian and I shared some
<i>Bier</i> (Many good ideas come after doing that). We realized
that in Munich there was not a place where people
interested in such areas could share knowledge  and meet other like-minded
persons. We decided  then to fill that gap by organizing such group, having
regular meetings featuring talks on those topics.
For the name, we took the inspiration from an already existing group in <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Paris-Datageeks/">Paris</a>.
</p>

<p>
For planning the first event  we  decided to write down a set
guidelines containing the philosophy behind the group. We thought that by
doing it, it will help us to keep the meeting with the same structure. They
are not carved in  stone, but so far we believe they have worked pretty well. I am
going to share them so you can have an idea of what to expect in our meetups:
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>(Almost) Monthly Meetup</b>: We want to have one meeting every 4-6 weeks
maximum.  It is not a hard limit but we don't want to have a lot of
time between meetings.  We want a engaged community and a continuous
exchange of ideas :).</li>
</ul>

<br/>
The First meeting at <a href="http://www.trustyou.com">TrustYou</a>.
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Networking is important</b>: We don't want people to come and listen to talks
like zombies. We actually want people interested in similar or related
fields know each other. For that reason we will have  time for
networking at the beginning, between talks and at the end. The sponsor will provide
<i>Bier</i> and food to loosen up the people and  spark friendly conversations :).</li>

<li><b>Not to  product pitches</b>: We like talks that
mix concepts with practical application. However, we don't want to be a
venue for closed / paid products or companies. We  that know sometimes people
work in specific environments that are not open (e.g. Matlab) however, we
think if the concepts are more important that the tool itself then there
is no problem, but if the talk is centered on a specific tool, then the tool should be
free / open source / available.</li>

<li><b>Research and Industry</b>: We want to get into the same room software
developers / data scientist with researchers. We believe that  were
people working in the industry (or "real life") can meet researchers.
Both sides can benefit from it. Researcher might see what are the current
problems that the industry faces  and developers can see fresh results or
current research trends.</li>

<li><b>Talks are held in English</b>: Although we are in Germany and
German is the official language, there are plenty of people which are not
fluent enough (I include myself in this
group) in it. In addition to this, we want to include recently landed M.Sc. /
Ph.d / Post Docs and developers / data scientists that not necessarily speak German.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>From the community to the community</b>: The idea of the meetings is to share
knowledge from within the community in Munich. So we encourage people and
attendants to present. We do invite people we know that work on the
subjects and we think their work is interesting, and that they don't
necessarily live in Munich,  but we prefer and love to
receive talk proposal from the same people that attend the events .</li>
</ul>

The second  meetup at <a href="http://www.stylight.com">Stylight</a>.
</div>

<p>
Using these guidelines as basis we have successfully organized the first two meetings.
<a href="http://trustyou.com/">TrustYou</a> (the company where Florian works) sponsored the first meetup. They
provided the location and the food/drinks. In this first meeting we had two
interesting talks one coming from the university and the other one from the
industry.  <a href="http://home.in.tum.de/~xiaoh/">Han Xiao</a> from the chair of computer security of <a href="http://www.tum.de/">TUM</a>,  shared with us his research
in the field of adversarial machine learning and  <a href="http://stepien.cc/~jan/">Jan Stepien</a> shared his
experiences analyzing his personal internet navigation data.
</p>

<p>
We were really happy with the results of the first meetup. As I mentioned before than 45
people attended the meetup (during sunny afternoon in Munich which makes it
even more significant). We had a really
spacious room with top notch projector and sound and in my personal view both
talks where really good and understandable (even when Han showed his math
mojo in order to describe properly a problem).

Food for thought and for the body
</div>

<p>
The second meetup was sponsored by <a href="http://www.stylight.com/">Stylight</a>. They have an awesome office with
at an excellent location. This time we had three talks, one about MongoDB by
<a href="https://github.com/droustchev">Dimitar</a>, another about Event Processing by <a href="https://twitter.com/ifesdjeen">Alex</a> and one about Real Time Robot
control using Neural Networks  by <a href="https://github.com/bayerj">Justin</a>. Besides some minor problems with the projector the Meetup
went smoothly and we had really good feedback from the attendants.
</p>

<p>
You can find all the slides of the talks  on the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/munichdata/">Speakerdeck account</a> we created for
storing them.
</p>

<p>
For the next meeting we have some nice ideas that we want to try and and really
cool talks as well. We will be announcing the next meetup shortly, I think
it will be shortly after Oktoberfest (Wiesn). It will be probably in the
brand new <a href="http://www.gini.net/">Gini</a> office but I will confirm this soon.
We are constantly looking for sponsors, so if  your company would like to
sponsor our meetup please just drop us a line.
</p>

<p>
If you are reading this (and you happen to be in Munich)  and would like to
attend or present in  our group please sign in in our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Munich-Datageeks/">Meetup.com page</a> and send
us an e-mail (the e-mail is necessary only if you want to present).
We will love to have more DataGeeks to share knowledge with.

<b>UPDATE</b>
</p>

<p>
I forgot to mention the origin of the logo. As neither I or Florian are
designers, I asked my siter, who runs  along with ther husband a <a href="http://www.rocamoraestudio.com/">design agency</a>,
to take an hour from her busy schedule to design
something. Well, she did it and you can see the result on top of this page. Thanks
Sis :)
