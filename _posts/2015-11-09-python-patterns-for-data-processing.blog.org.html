<p>
I came into touch with Python back when I coursing a M.Sc. at the <a href="http://www.tum.de/">TUM</a> during a Deep Learning
<a href="https://github.com/mfcabrera/deeplearning-praktikum-ss2013">pratical course</a>. By then I knew Python was becoming popular in the sciences
as a replacement for Matlab, in particular the <a href="http://brml.org/brml/">research group</a> offering the
coursea was particulary invested in its use for NN programming.That meant that the first things
I learned about the language   was basic usage of numerical/machine learning libraries such as <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">Numpy</a> and <a href="http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/">Theano</a>.
</p>

<p>
The issue of learning Python that way, is that I never had a proper introduction to the language from  Software Engineering
perspetive. I had no idea about built-in libraries, idioms and the tools surrounding it. The risk with this is than when developing data science related
software one might end up writing some <a href="http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/10/04/engineering-practices-in-data-science/">spaguetti data science code</a>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
When I started working as Data Engineer/Scientist for TrustYou that was mi situation. I had previously
worked as Software Developer (mostly Java/Scala based environments) previously, so I knew some of the Software Engineering
language agnost techniques and practices (Object Oriented programming, design patterns, data structures) I was not familiar
at all with Python standard libraries and the idioms. These, in my humble opinion are key for writing maintainable code.

Although I suspected of the existence of such "best practices" (I kind of hate that term)  I must  confess  did not try hard to follow any standard, nor they were required from my employer.
Also, my lack of knowledge of Python did not allow me to use powerful language constructs.  Needless to say the quality of my code was subpar.
After the couple of projects I started learning more about existing standards and tool set, i.e. coding conventions,  project structure, testing, packaging, etc.
</pre>

<p>
So, for a bit more than a year  I have been working with Python, slowly learning about the stack. I have "found" a collection of technques that
help a lot for data cleaning and processing, important steps in any data science pipeline.  I can divide such features or tricks into two categories.
The first one are those features that allow you write clean maitainable code, namely code with [[ ]SOLID]] charactersitics and the other ones that
allows you to do data processing either better, faster or cleaner and have a different purpose of usual stack of used by Python Data Scientist (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas).
</p>

<p>
Some disclaimers here:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many Python software developers are familiar with thes techniques but most of the people starting with Python and in
particular those learning Python along  Numpy, Scipy, Pandas and similar frameworks are not.</li>

<li>Most of Data Structures in Python are indeed slower than many Numpy counterpart, but some of them are way more flexible.(Write more about this)</li>

<li>Sometimes when writing Data Processing Pipelines you are processing record by record, i.e. in a <i>map</i> stage of a
Hadoop Job, or the the data is relative large, semi-structured or textual data, holding in Numpy array or Pandas DataFrame does not make sense.</li>

<li>Sometimes you want to integrate your models with existing software and you want to do it in a clean and idiomatic ways or you want to make
them maintainable or easily extended.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I can divide the things I found in two broad categories, best practices thar are language agnostic and features/libraries of Python that allow
you to write data processing pipelines in a better way.
</p>

<p>
I can divide the things I found into two categories: features of Python that allow you to write clean reusable code and features of Python that
make data processing easier.
</p>

<p>
So with this in mind, let's get started.

<h3 id="orgheadline2">Autovivification</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autovivification#Python">Autovivification</a>  as cool as its name, and it is not because is reminds you of the <i>Walking Dead</i> (does it?), it is because is a nice
way of generating tree-like structures in Python using dictionaries. Let's take the example found in Wikipedia:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">from</span> collections <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> defaultdict

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">tree</span>():
<span style="color: #DCDCCC; background-color: #4F4F4F;"> </span>  <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">return</span> defaultdict(tree)

<span style="color: #5F7F5F;"># </span><span style="color: #7F9F7F;">common name by class, order, genus, and type-species</span>
<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">common_name</span> = tree()
common_name[<span style="color: #CC9393;">'Mammalia'</span>][<span style="color: #CC9393;">'Primates'</span>][<span style="color: #CC9393;">'Homo'</span>][<span style="color: #CC9393;">'H. sapiens'</span>] = <span style="color: #CC9393;">'human being'</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">return</span> common_name
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So let's start slow. We are using the <code>defaultdict</code> class from the <code>collections</code> module. This module is gold for data processing related tasks, as it contains specializedd
alternatives to the general purpose data structures. The <code>defaultdict</code> class works in the following way:  It works like normal dictionary with the exception that
when a key does not exists in a dictonary, instead of throwing a <code>KeyError</code> will create a default element for that key and return it. The default element is created
by a function that is pass as parameter (in this case <code>tree</code>). So if you write <code>defaultdict(list)</code> it will create a default item that is an empty list.
</p>

<p>
The autovivification works by using a nice recursive function creating <code>defaultdict(list)</code> which default element is also a default tree. Well, why is this useful in the context of
data processing and evaluation. Well something you are reading tabular files (i.e. <code>tsv</code>, <code>csv</code>, etc) that its content can be arranged in a tree like manner, but you don't know the depth.
</p>

<p>
This <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/635483/what-is-the-best-way-to-implement-nested-dictionaries-in-python">question</a> on Stackoverflow shows different alternatives to do the same (maybe in a cleaner way):
</p>


<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">class</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">Vividict</span>(<span style="color: #DCDCCC; font-weight: bold;">dict</span>):
<span style="color: #DCDCCC; background-color: #4F4F4F;"> </span>   <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">__missing__</span>(<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">self</span>, key):
<span style="color: #DCDCCC; background-color: #4F4F4F;"> </span>   <span style="color: #DCDCCC; background-color: #4F4F4F;"> </span>   <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">value</span> = <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">self</span>[key] = <span style="color: #DCDCCC; font-weight: bold;">type</span>(<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">self</span>)()
<span style="color: #DCDCCC; background-color: #4F4F4F;"> </span>   <span style="color: #DCDCCC; background-color: #4F4F4F;"> </span>   <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">return</span> value
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It is the same idea. In this case, if the item is not found the <code>__missing__</code> special function is called
and the a default dict (of the same subtye) is returned.
</p>

<p>
Let's say we have a fictional tabular data and we need to form a tree like structure with and arbitrary structure
The first column is an <i>id</i>, the second is a <i>query</i> and the two last columns are two scores:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-right" />

<col  class="org-right" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">id-1</td>
<td class="org-left">a</td>
<td class="org-right">20</td>
<td class="org-right">10</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">id-2</td>
<td class="org-left">a</td>
<td class="org-right">50</td>
<td class="org-right">&#xa0;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">id-1</td>
<td class="org-left">b</td>
<td class="org-right">-1</td>
<td class="org-right">-5</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">id-3</td>
<td class="org-left">c</td>
<td class="org-right">10</td>
<td class="org-right">30</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">id-2</td>
<td class="org-left">d</td>
<td class="org-right">-1</td>
<td class="org-right">-2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
And let's say we would like to end up with something like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-json">{<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">"id-1"</span>:
 {<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">"a"</span> :
  {<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">"score_1"</span> : <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">20</span>, <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">"score_2"</span> : <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">10</span>  }
 }
 {<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">"b"</span> :
  {<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">"score_1"</span> : -<span style="color: #BFEBBF;">1</span>, <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">"score_2"</span> : -<span style="color: #BFEBBF;">5</span>  }
 }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There are many ways to parse this, but using the trick we learned before would be something like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">from</span> collections <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> defaultdict

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">tree</span>():
<span style="color: #DCDCCC; background-color: #4F4F4F;"> </span>  <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">return</span> defaultdict(tree)

<span style="color: #5F7F5F;"># </span><span style="color: #7F9F7F;">common name by class, order, genus, and type-species</span>
<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">common_name</span> = tree()
common_name[<span style="color: #CC9393;">'Mammalia'</span>][<span style="color: #CC9393;">'Primates'</span>][<span style="color: #CC9393;">'Homo'</span>][<span style="color: #CC9393;">'H. sapiens'</span>] = <span style="color: #CC9393;">'human being'</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">return</span> common_name
</pre>
</div>


<p>
dictionary the a funtion will be executed to create a default element for that key.
</p>

<p>
As you can see from the results, each time the we  call <code>common_name[key]</code>  the tree function is called returns another <code>defaultdict</code>.
