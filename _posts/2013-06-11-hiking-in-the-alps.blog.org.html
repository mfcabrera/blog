One of the things I like about my <a href="http://www.tum.de/">my university</a> is that they have a really
cool international office: the <a href="http://www.international.tum.de/en/">TUMi</a>. Among other things, TUMi organizes
activities and trips to nearby cities. These activities are generally
targeted at international / exchange
students, with the purpose of allowing them to get to know the culture of
Bavaria and  Germany.
</p>

<p>
Normally I don't attend TUMi events as much as I would like.
However,  this time there was a Hiking trip to the
Bavarian Alps. Since I arrived in Germany I have not had the opportunity of
experiencing this part of the Bavarian geography during summer time. I was not
really sure what to expect from the trip but I have to say that it was an amazing
experience. I had  the chance to enjoy the Bavaria landscapes and, at the same
time, to meet really nice people.

So, the idea of the trip was to hike to the <a href="http://www.soiernhaus.de/">Soiernhaus</a>, a small cottage next to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soiernspitze">Soiernspitze</a>, the highest peak of the the Soiern group. A group of mountains
in the south of Germany. Once there, we wanted to spend the night there and
the following day return, but this time  by going to the top of the
mountain and going down to the valley.
</p>

<p>
It might not sound that hard, but it  was my first time
hiking in the mountains,  and therefore I did not have the appropriate
equipment for such a adventure (No hiking shoes but sneakers,
not good jacket, and so on). However, we all managed to get there without
major problems and only with some sore muscles the day after as a result of
the long walk.

To get there we took a train from
Munich Hauptbahnhof (central station) to a station close to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garmisch-Partenkirchen">Garmisch-Partenkirchen</a>. From there we headed to a
nearby town called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kr%C3%BCn">Kr√ºn</a>, and then we started going up through the
mountains. The hike was good. It had a really challenging part, due to
its steepness. As most of us were not "fit", we had some breaks along the way.
During one of those breaks the guide took out some speakers from his backpack and
started playing some Bavarian traditional music, very suitable for the
occasion I would say. It was a bit surreal walking up  the mountains and
at the same time listening to this type of music. To give you an idea of the
overall route, below you can see the GPS
data of the first day.

After arriving to the cottage we could finally have some rest. Some of us went to the
lake but  sadly it started raining almost immediately and we quickly  rushed
back. After the rain stopped  we had the chance of  watching
beautiful sunset. We spent the evening inside cottage having some bier and
eating some traditional food.  We had funny  talk about how to say
"Spooning" in different languages (it looks like there's not word for that
in Bulgarian) and we played some cards. Some people went to bed quite early
but others, like me, stayed a little bit late enjoying the conversation.

<p>
The  next day some of our group decided to go a do a morning hike to a nearby
peak. I was too tired and I decided to sleep a bit more (yeah, yeah, I am
lazyass). Around 8:00 AM we had breakfast and we started to walk again. The
locidea was to cross the main mountain (we went around the first day) and go
down  through the valley in order to reach <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittenwald">Mittenwald</a>, where we would take
the train back to Munich.

Hiking/Climbing the Soiernspitze

<p>
This was pretty tough. The path, although easy too find, was hard and steep. It had also
many snow patches  of snow making it slippery. That is not good at all when
you high on a mountain walking on a narrow path. I can say I felt scared at
times,  because I was not wearing good equipment. Luckily, nothing
happened at then end  and we could enjoy the great view from the top of the
Soiernspitze while having fun going down the mountain.  By the end of the day though, we were
exhausted and we were only looking forward to catch the train. Below the GPS data for the second day.

This was a really unique experience for me. I did not know how
popular the Hiking paths of the south of Bavaria were and that hiking was
such a popular activity among Germans. I fell in love with the Bavarian
landscapes and the imposing mountains of the Bavarian Alps. I would like to
thank the TUMi crew for such a great opportunity and all the group of "TUMis" for being
such a great bunch of people to hike with. Now I am just thinking when and
where my next hike is going to be. I am really looking forward to going south again
and exploring another part of the beautiful Bavarian Alps geography.
